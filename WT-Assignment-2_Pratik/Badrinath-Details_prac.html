                    <p><b>Badrinath</b> Temple is located in a small town Badrinath which is in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and boasts high religious significance. With Alaknanda River flowing by the side and a backdrop full of snow clad mountains Badrinath Temple is an absolute visual treat. It is one of the most revered pilgrimage sites of “Char Dham” (four abodes) which in turn is the most scared set of pilgrimage sites in Hindu religion. Every year thousands and thousands of disciples visit this temple. Located at the height of 3133 meters above the sea level Badrinath Temple is not easy to reach. One has to drive through hilly terrains with dangerous cliffs and curves to reach the temple. But this doesn’t deter disciples from pouring in every year in large numbers.</p><br/>
                    <p><b>History of Badrinath Temple : </b><br/><br/>Legends says that Adi Shankara found an idol of Badrinath in the Alaknanda River. Later he enshrined the same image in a cave near the hot spring of Tapt Kund, which is now known as the Badrinath Temple. It is also believed that during Satya Yuga Lord Shiva meditated here for many years. And all those years Goddess Lakshmi transformed into a Badri tree to provide shadow to Lord Shiva. This is how the place got its name as Badrinath. It is believed that the whole area in and around Badrinath was abode of Lord Shiva. This is one the reasons that the temple is jam packed during Maha Shivratri.</p>
