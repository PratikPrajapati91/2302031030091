The present temple is believed to have been built by Adi Guru Shankaracharya in the 8th century, which is located right next to the temple built by the Pandavas.  In most places of the temple, something has been written in Brahmi and Pali script which is very difficult to understand.Near the Kedarnath temple is the temple of Shri BhairavNath, the protector of Kedarnath, without whose darshan the KedarnathYatra is considered incomplete.
